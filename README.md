# UFOs

## Overview of the project
This project was designed to help us learn Javascript and understand how we could leverage D3 to create interactive web pages with HTML and CSS. We were tasked with helping Dana build out a webpage to display information on UFO sightings in a table that would take input on filters and adjust the table accordingly.

## Results: A Guide to Using the Webpage
Opening the webpage, you are able to see an introduction to the page, along with a paragraph asking the question to the user:

The real meat of the page is in the interactive table. On the left hand side we have components that give the user the ability to enter filters. This will in turn filter the data within the table:

Before the filters:

After the filters:

And again:

As a result, users may use this table to hone in on sightings that are the most relevant or interesting to them! 

## Summary
With all the adjustments, there are still a couple drawbacks to the design. Some further developments could include:
- Breaking out the description, as it is sometimes cut off and the user can not view the entire description
- Displaying the total amount of rows in the table could be useful to the user also!
- Inserting a clear all button may also be a better UX, as going through and removing each filter to get back to the original table is a little inefficient
